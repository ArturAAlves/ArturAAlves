<h4>What is Software Testing</h4>
 <p>Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure that software product is Defect free. It involves execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest. The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements.</p>

<h4>Why Software Testing is Important?</h4> 
<p>Software Testing is Important because if there are any bugs or errors in the software, it can be identified early and can be solved before delivery of the software product. Properly tested software product ensures reliability, security and high performance which further results in time saving, cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.</p>

<h4>What are the benefits of Software Testing?</h4> 
 - <strong> Cost-Effective </strong>: It is one of the important advantages of software testing. Testing any IT project on time helps you to save your money for the long term. In case if the bugs caught in the earlier stage of software testing, it costs less to fix.
 - <strong> Security </strong>: It is the most vulnerable and sensitive benefit of software testing. People are looking for trusted products. It helps in removing risks and problems earlier.
 - <strong> Product quality </strong>: It is an essential requirement of any software product. Testing ensures a quality product is delivered to customers.
 - <strong> Customer Satisfaction </strong>: The main aim of any product is to give satisfaction to their customers. UI/UX Testing ensures the best user experience.</p>
